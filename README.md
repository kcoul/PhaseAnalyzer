# PhaseAnalyzer
C++ plugin built with the JUCE Framework to provide insight about the relative phase relationship of audio signals, built specifically to help audio engineers with drum overhead microphone placement.Â 

# Dependancies
In order to build the plugin for your specific platform you will need the Projucer and the JUCE Library which can be found at [https://www.juce.com/get-juce/download](https://www.juce.com/get-juce/download).

You can then open the .jucer file and then use the Projucer to generate an appropriate project file for your IDE. 

# More Info and Builds
For a full explanation of the theory behind the operation of the plugin as well validation of its performance please check out the report on my [website](https://www.christiansteinmetz.com/projects-blog/phase). 

Downloads for the Mac OS X AU/VST plugin are available on my website as well.
